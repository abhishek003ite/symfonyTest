Rest API For Banking System
===========================

A Symfony Rest API for Banking System where admin can create customers and create transactions. I will submit the UI also with separate Repo


Instructions To Access The API:
1. Open Postman or any third party application to run the web services.
2. Run the terminal and start our server
3. Go to your application folder and run following command.
    $>php bin/console server:run
4. You need to take complete backup because I have made some changes on bundles code.
5. after running your server on port 8000 you can access the application on postman.
